# Geekhack Scraper

## Motivation

I believe that for the average user, keeping up with geekhack can be somewhat tidious even if they are interested in getting something custom.

I think massdrop is a good example of grabbing enough attention for average users. I think being able to see a photo of the group buy along with a title is a lot better than clicking through every single group buy on geekhack just to see what it looks like. Forums unfortunatly don't normally work that way. So I made this project to hopefully bring more attention to group buys.
