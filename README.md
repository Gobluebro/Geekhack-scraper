# Geekhack Scraper

## Motivation

I believe that for the average user, keeping up with geekhack can be somewhat tidious even if they are interested in getting something custom.

I think massdrop is a good example of grabbing enough attention for average users. I think being able to see a photo of the group buy along with a title is a lot better than clicking through every single group buy on geekhack just to see what it looks like. Forums unfortunatly don't normally work that way. So I made this project to hopefully bring more attention to group buys.

I'm also trying to alivate these community upholded lists with automation. The main issue is that when you scrape a photo, it's hard to know if that photo is important or not and I believe it will require someone to decide if the photo is representative of the group buy or not.

**Requests / Interest Checks made by users:**

- [IC Group Buy List](https://old.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/bmdtlo/ic_group_buy_list/)

**Community Made and Curated Lists:**

- [LIST OF CURRENTLY RUNNING COMUNITY AND VENDOR GROUP BUYS](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=57761.0)

Just wanted to mention that this web scraping shouldn't be a replacement for things like:

- [Top Clack](https://www.youtube.com/c/topclack)
- [Man Of Interests](https://youtube.com/manofinterests)

It should be used just to spark interest enough for a user to click a link to go to the geekhack thread.
